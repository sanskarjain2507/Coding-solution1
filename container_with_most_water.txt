            In this we take two pointer l,r placed at start and end of array and we first calculate the 
            water that can be fed between these two pointers and store them in maxwater.
            
            Now we will move that pointer whoose height is less and we do this because if we move 
            greater height pointer then no matter how high the next adjacent pointer is its area 
            with the low height pointer will obviously will be less than the area it make with the 
            previous pointer,HENCE WE MOVE POINTER WITH LESSER HEIGHT.
